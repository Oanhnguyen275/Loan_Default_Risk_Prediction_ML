# Loan Risk Prediction ‚Äì Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

**Loan_risk_ML** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the risk level of loan applicants. By analyzing financial data, the project classifies applicants as either low-risk or high-risk borrowers. This classification assists financial institutions in making informed lending decisions, thereby mitigating potential defaults.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Highlights

- **Objective**: Predict the likelihood of loan default by classifying applicants into low-risk or high-risk categories.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a synthetic dataset containing financial information of loan applicants.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification.
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
  - **Precision**: Indicates the accuracy of positive predictions.
  - **Recall**: Shows the ability of the model to capture all positive instances.
  - **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

## üéØ Outcome

The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict loan default risk. The Random Forest Classifier outperformed the Logistic Regression model, achieving higher accuracy and F1-score, indicating its effectiveness in identifying high-risk loan applicants.

Confusion Matrix:

[[14924    77]
 [   31   476]]

Interpretation:

14,924 correctly predicted low-risk loans (0).

77 incorrectly predicted low-risk loans (0) when they were actually high-risk (1).

31 incorrectly predicted high-risk loans (1) when they were actually low-risk (0).

476 correctly predicted high-risk loans (1).
